A file detailing a bug we encountered in this assignment and how we approached debugging it:

Problem:

There was an infinite loop when printing ‘error notes’ for the user upon invalid input. 
This error seemed to be a fundamental problem with the way the functions were structured.

Approach:
To identify the root of the problem, we added print statements at various spots in the code. 
This allowed us to identify the function and the loop which was causing these infinite print statements. 
For each word input, this function was being called repeatedly.

Solution:
Creating an additional helper function for the error prints, and altering their position in the while loop fixed the problem. 
Since it was a nested while loop, the location had to be altered to be just before the ladder was called, and to re-prompt 
the user just after it.

Learning:
Planning out the helper functions with a Top-Down model would prevent such issues from emerging.
